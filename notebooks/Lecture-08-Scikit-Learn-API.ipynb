    "Rarely are we gifted data sets which can immediately be fit to models.  Typically we need a set of transformations which engineer our features before actually fitting.  While in principle these transformations can be done outside of `scikit-learn`, it can become difficult to manage these transformations for the following reasons:\n",

We define a pipeline as a list of tuples, where each tuple is a `(key, estimator)` pair.  We will build a simple `Pipeline` which will scale the input data and then fit a  model (the model is a `Ridge` reqression model for which it is beneficial to have scaled inputs so that the regularization of the model coefficients can also use a common scale).  \n",

    "There are times when it can be useful to convert distributions like this into a more normal distribution.  `scikit-learn` offers transformers to do this, but they by default operate over all columns which are passed to them.  We can thus use the `ColumnTransformer` to only transformer a single column.  The object is created with a tuple of `(name, transformer, column_selector)` where the `column_selector` is either a list of column indices or a list of column names (if using a `DataFrame`) which will be passed to the transformer.\n",
