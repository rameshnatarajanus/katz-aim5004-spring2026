    "1. The starting point for developing the notebook-based instruction material was the set of notebooks provided by the previous  course instructor__[Prof. Zach Glassman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-glassman-7088844b/)__.\n",
    "2. These notebooks have been augmented by similar instruction material taken from many, many other sources, including official documentation from many ML libraries and frameworks. I have adapted and modified the content where needed to make it compatible with student level, orientation and proficiency in this course.\n",
    "3. The primary addition sources include:\n",
    "   1. Course content from V. Kuleshov, Cornell Tech __[repo](https://github.com/kuleshov/cornell-cs5785-2020-applied-ml/blob/main/notebooks/lecture1-introduction.ipynb)__.\n",
    "   2. Book and support material from Hal Daume II, __[A course in Machine Learning](http://ciml.info)__. __[repo](https://github.com/hal3/ciml/)__\n",
    "   3. Book and support material from A. Geron, __[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow (3rd edition)](https://homl.info/er3)__. __[repo](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/README.md)__\n",
